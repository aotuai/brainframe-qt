summary: A smart vision platform that is built to be easy to scale and deploy
description: >
  BrainFrame is a smart vision platform that is built to be easy to scale,
  highly configurable, and deployable on-premises or to the cloud. This is its
  client.

  Powered by our automatic algorithm fusion and optimization engine,
  BrainFrame enables plug and play integration of VisionCapsules. This platform
  turns any connected camera into a smart sensor for sophisticated monitoring
  and inspection tasks, serving a variety of vertical markets.

  The client makes it easy to configure video streams, set up zones, and manage
  VisionCapsules without any programming experience.
# TODO: Update to core20 when the kde-neon extension supports it.
